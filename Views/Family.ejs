    <p class="cst-FamilyDescription">My family is from a village in Bihar, India. Due to my father's government job, I've had the opportunity to explore new places and experience diverse cultures of India. We have a strong, close-knit family blessed with the wisdom of our elders (grandparents), who live with us and generously share their stories and experiences.</p>

        <p class="cst-FamilyInfo">Born in 1972 in Bihar, India, my father left home at a young age to pursue better education, staying with his uncle in Bokaro, Jharkhand. He completed his schooling there and went on to earn a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra (formerly RIT Kurukshetra). He began his career at JK Tyres and later secured a government job with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited. After a few years, he transitioned to NTPC (formerly National Thermal Power Corporation).</p>
        <p class="cst-FamilyInfo">My father is a loving and caring person who perfectly balances his personal and professional life. Despite his busy schedule, he always makes time for us. For him, family is the highest priority. Even when he and my mother were posted in different locations, he made sure we never felt his absence. His technical knowledge and vast experience mean he can guide me on almost anything. He knows when to be strict and when to be gentle, and he's always cheering me on and encouraging me to follow my dreams.</p>
